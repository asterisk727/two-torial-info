# Info / My Statement on the privating of TWO-TORIAL resources
## WTF is happening?
Hi. For those who don't follow drama in their rhythm game Discord servers, there's been some drama. 

tl;dr shit happened and TWO-TORIAL, the community's go-to source for installation/troubleshooting guides and game patching privated everything.

## So... What is this?

I felt like it would be a massive shame if the community lost this resource overnight. So, I set up mirrors (frozen-in-time replicas) of the original TWO-TORIAL project's pages.

The following old pages are now mirrored at the following (sub)domains:

- `two-torial.xyz` (Installation, troubleshooting guide) -> [two-torial.maimaidxprism.plus](https://two-torial.maimaidxprism.plus)
- `patcher.two-torial.xyz` (Patcher for non spice2x games) -> [webpatcher.maimaidxprism.plus](https://webpatcher.maimaidxprism.plus)
- `sp2x.two-torial.xyz` (Patch files source for spice2x games) -> [sp2x.maimaidxprism.plus](https://sp2x.maimaidxprism.plus)

Links at these pages pointing to now-defunct TWO-TORIAL websites have been changed to their respective mirrors. Additionally, messages were placed next to those links noting that they are mirrors, and the info messages that probably got you to this page were also added.

### How up to date is this?
As up-to-date as possible and likely better than any other mirrors out there. \
beerpsi (thank you goat) has Github organization access to TWO-TORIAL and sent the base repositories after they were privated. \
It has not been modified since TWO-TORIAL was privated initially, other than changing links referring to the old TWO-TORIAL and adding info messages.

### What is the future of TWO-TORIAL? Will this reccieve updates? 
As of now, not really. \
I set up this mirror by myself and I am not nearly knowledgable enough in the black magic fuckery that established community members use to make patches for new game versions. \
I will try to keep this mirror up for as long as I can. 

If anyone is interested in helping me continue the legacy of TWO-TORIAL, you can reach me at my discord account: `asterisk727`. Resources like these are important for both new, intermediate, and experienced members of our community.


### domain name?
idk I just had it lying around not doing anything. it's better than the other useless domain I have (see [yeswecantouch.tips](https://yeswecantouch.tips))
